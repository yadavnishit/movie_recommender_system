Movie Recommender System
This project is a content-based movie recommender system built using Python. It takes a movie title as input and recommends similar movies based on the overview and other metadata using NLP and cosine similarity.

ðŸš€ What It Does
You enter the name of a movie, and the system gives you a list of similar movies you might enjoy. It does this by analyzing the descriptions (overviews) and computing similarity scores.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Dataset: Pulled from TMDB with metadata like title, overview, genres, etc.

Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled. Only relevant columns are selected.

Text Processing: Movie overviews are transformed into vectors using CountVectorizer.

Similarity: Cosine similarity is used to find and rank similar movies.

Recommendation Logic: Top N similar movies are shown based on a selected movie.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“‚ Files
movie_recommended_system.ipynb: Main notebook with the complete implementation.

tmdb_5000_movies.csv: Dataset with movie metadata (you'll need this to run it).

README.md: You're reading it.

âœ… How To Run
Clone the repo or download the notebook.

Make sure the required libraries are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Run the notebook:
Open movie_recommended_system.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible editor.

Replace the movie title in the last cell with your favorite movie and run the cell to get recommendations.

ðŸ§  Example Output

1. Aliens vs Predator: Requiem
2. Battle: Los Angeles
3. John Carter
4. The Helix... Loaded
5. Star Trek Into Darkness
ðŸ“Œ Limitations
Only works with the movies present in the dataset.

Recommendations are based purely on content (text), not user behavior or ratings.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
Add collaborative filtering.

Integrate with a web interface using Streamlit or Flask.

Improve NLP using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
