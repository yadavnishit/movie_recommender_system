#Movie Recommender System

Movie Recommender System

A simple content-based movie recommender built with Python. Enter a movie title, get a list of similar movies based on the plot summaries using NLP and cosine similarity.

ðŸš€ What It Does
You type in a movie name. It looks at the movie's overview, compares it to others, and recommends similar titles.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
Dataset: Comes from TMDB, includes title, overview, genre, etc.

Cleaning: Filters out missing data and irrelevant columns.

Text Vectorization: Uses CountVectorizer to convert overviews into vectors.

Similarity: Uses cosine similarity to find and rank similar movies.

Recommendation: Returns top N closest matches to the input movie.

âœ… How to Run It
Clone this repo or download the notebook

Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Open movie_recommended_system.ipynb in Jupyter or any compatible editor

Replace the movie name in the last cell with one of your choice:

python
Copy
Edit
recommend('Avatar')
Run the cell to get recommendations.

ðŸ§  Example Output

1. Aliens vs Predator: Requiem  
2. Battle: Los Angeles  
3. John Carter  
4. The Helix... Loaded  
5. Star Trek Into Darkness  
ðŸ“Œ Limitations
Only works for movies in the dataset

No personalization â€” it doesnâ€™t learn user preferences

Relies on overview text only, not cast, ratings, or user data

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
Add collaborative filtering

Build a web interface using Streamlit or Flask

Use TF-IDF or advanced NLP techniques (e.g. BERT) for better vectorization

Dataset: TMDB via Kaggle
